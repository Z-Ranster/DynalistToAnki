# DynalistToAnki
A small program to take entries from Dynalist and automatically convert them to Anki Cards.

Overall Goal:
The goal is to be able to bulk upload cards. Currently it takes me 2 min/card and I may create 20 - 40 cards a week, so if you get backlogged good luck. I want the importing of cards to be fast so I can load more information into the system and review the content more regularly.

Current Focus:
- Outline the overall project so that the program can handle basic cards

Future Focus:
- Cards with LaTex
- Cards with images
